<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type,
     and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: -->



<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- html lang="en">: This tag represents the root element
    of the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute specifies
     that the language of the document is English. -->
<html lang="en">

<!-- head>: This tag encloses metadata about the document,
     such as its title, character encoding, and viewport settings
     . Metadata is information about the data within the document. -->
<head>
    <!-- <meta charset="UTF-8">: This meta tag specifies the
         character encoding for the document, which is UTF-8.
          UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding 
          all possible characters in Unicode. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
        This meta tag sets the viewport properties for the document.
         It tells the browser to set the width of the viewport to the 
         width of the device and set the initial zoom level to 1.0,
          which means the page will be displayed at its actual size without any zooming. -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- <title>Document</title>: This tag defines the
         title of the HTML document, which typically 
         appears in the browser's title bar or tab. -->
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<!-- <body>: This tag represents the content of the
     HTML document, including text, images, links, 
     and other elements that are visible to the user when rendered in a web browser. -->
